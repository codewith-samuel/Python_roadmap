## Beginner Level 🐣
Get comfortable with Python basics and start coding simple programs.

**Topics:**
- Installing Python and setting up an IDE (e.g., VS Code)
- Variables and Data Types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Basic Operations (arithmetic, comparison)
- Input/Output (`print()`, `input()`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

**Example Code:**
```python
# Simple Calculator
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
print(f"Sum: {num1 + num2}")
