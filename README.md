## Beginner Basics 🌱
Learn the essentials to start coding in Python.

**What to Learn:**
- Setting up Python and an editor (like VS Code)
- Variables (`int`, `str`, `float`, etc.)
- Math operations (+, -, *, /)
- User input and output (`input()`, `print()`)
- If-statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Lists and basic data structures

**Try This Code:**
```python
# Guess the Number
secret = 7
guess = int(input("Guess a number (1-10): "))
if guess == secret:
    print("You got it! 🎉")
else:
    print("Try again!")
```
**Challenge:**
Create a program that asks for your name and prints a greeting.

---

## Intermediate Skills 🛠️
Build deeper skills for real-world coding.

**What to Learn:**
- Functions (writing and calling them)
- Modules (import stuff like `random`)
- File operations (read/write text files)
- Handling errors (`try`, `except`)
- Classes and objects (OOP basics)
- Shortcuts like list comprehensions

**Try This Code:**
```python
# Coin Flip Simulator
import random
flips = [random.choice(["Heads", "Tails"]) for _ in range(3)]
print("Flips:", flips)
print("Heads count:", flips.count("Heads"))
```
**Challenge:**
Make a program that saves a shopping list to a file.

---

## Advanced Mastery 🚀
Take your Python skills to the next level.

**What to Learn:**
- Anonymous functions (`lambda`)
- Threading for multitasking
- Pattern matching with regex (`re`)
- APIs and web data (`requests`)
- Data crunching (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- Web apps (`Flask` or `Django`)
- Testing your code (`pytest`)

**Try This Code:**
```python
# Quote Fetcher
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.quotable.io/random")
quote = response.json()["content"]
print("Random Quote:", quote)
```
**Challenge:**
Build a small app that shows today’s weather using an API.
