## Beginner Level 🐣
Get comfortable with Python basics and start coding simple programs.

**Topics:**
- Installing Python and setting up an IDE (e.g., VS Code)
- Variables and Data Types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Basic Operations (arithmetic, comparison)
- Input/Output (`print()`, `input()`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

**Example Code:**
```python
# Simple Calculator
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
print(f"Sum: {num1 + num2)")
Milestone:
Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle.

Intermediate Level 🛠️
Build on the basics and explore more complex concepts.

Topics:

Functions (defining, arguments, return values)
Modules and Packages (import, pip)
File Handling (reading/writing files)
Error Handling (try, except)
Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance)
List Comprehensions
Working with Libraries (e.g., math, random)
Example Code:
# Function with error handling
def divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Cannot divide by zero!"
print(divide(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0
Milestone:
Create a to-do list app that saves tasks to a file.

Advanced Level 🚀
Master Python with advanced tools and techniques.

Topics:

Decorators and Generators
Lambda Functions
Multithreading and Multiprocessing
Regular Expressions (re module)
Working with APIs (e.g., requests)
Data Analysis (pandas, numpy)
Web Development (Flask, Django)
Unit Testing (unittest, pytest)
Example Code:
# Fetching data from an API
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print(response.json())
Milestone:
Build a simple web app with Flask or a data analysis script with pandas.
